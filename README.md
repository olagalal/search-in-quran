# Search in Quran

[![Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-college%20project-orange?style=flat)](http://shields.io/)

A python app that searches for words containing specific letters in the Holy Quran and displays the results. We applied python OOP, KMP search and Levenshtein distance algorithm. For the GUI, we used PyQt5. This project was made for (NLP - Forth Year) in my college. The result contains: the name and number of the surah, the number of its verses, the verse number and number of search results.

**Levenshtein distance**

for example محفوظ

حفيظ حافظات بحفيظ محفوظاً حفيظاً
